http://localhost:3000/about
http://localhost:3000/blog/first-post
http://localhost:3000/products/iphone

Route group (by pass the '()' text)
http://localhost:3000/forgot-password
http://localhost:3000/login
http://localhost:3000/register

http://localhost:3000/products/iphone   <--- additional layout on top the the root layout
When navigating between pages that share a layout, only the page components update - the layout doesn't re-render.
This leads to improved performance and a smoother user experience.
It also help to reduce code duplication and improve the overall structure of your project

http://localhost:3000/products/1

- Create next <Link>
- Check active path
- Programmatically navigate to certain path (router.push from 'next/navigation').

http://localhost:3000/users-client
http://localhost:3000/users-server  <--- see the same set of users in user-client

server loading file as to be called 'loading.tsx'
server error file has to be called 'error.tsx'
next.js will automatically use these two files while loading the page.tsx in the same directory
